		<p> Well, I have to say that I am a big fan of them. So, let's talk a little bit about them. Although they lost the finals 2016, they did win 2015. If you know nothing about them, here's a video to show you how amazing they are.</p>

      		<p> Knowing nothing about them, you might search them up on Google. And what pops up is a guy, finger up, and his back says "Curry 30". He appears on almost every page. Is something wrong with Google? No, nothing is wrong. This is the Warriors MVP, Stephen Curry. Watch the games next season and see how great of a guy he is. And watch the videos below. Even without knowing basketball, these shots will amaze you off your chair.<p>

		<p class="card-text" style = "color:red">Pokemon Go is an awesome game designed for people of all ages made by the high-tech company Google assisted by Nintendo.It begins with a simple animated and less detailed version of the highly popular Google Maps. But that's not all to it. Pokemon, little creatures made to look like tiny monsters start appearing on the screen. But they don't come every minute. And they won't come if you stay in one spot. You have to move around. Common Pokemon can just be found by driving along your local road, but Pokemon with high CP(Conbat Power) are found in grassy locations or somewhere-only-Google-knows. You level up, buy items in stores, and the best part is catching the Pokemon you see with PokeBalls and then battling them in Gyms with your color-coded team. Here's a video to show you a closer look to Pokemon Go.</p>
